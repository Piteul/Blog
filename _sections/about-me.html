<p>
Besides my recursive humor, I was often blamed as a child for having my head in the clouds.
<br>
For lack of not paying attention at the time, I already had an overflow of imagination. 
<br>
<br>
Like the call of Cthulhu on the seabed, I constantly hear the call of creativity deep within me.
<br>
Like a vice aiming to answer this one, I turned to writing, musical composition or computer and video game development.
<br>
<br>
I don't want to offend you by saying that I've been playing since I was a child, or even that it's one of my passions.
<br>
However, I sincerely believe that video games have a lot to offer and that they can become a cultural and artistic vector as relevant as the Cinema.
