<p>ShmupCV is a subtle mix between the abbreviation for the "Shoot 'Em Up" genre and the "OpenCV" graphics library.</p>
<p>The project is -strongly- inspired by the class and classic "Ikaruga", Shmup in which you have to alternate between two colors to kill your enemies and complete the -infamous- levels. 
  Enormous innovation -which after reflection would deserve to be marketed at 30â‚¬-, in addition to being able to play on the keyboard, it is possible to play with an extraordinary device. Teasing.</p>
<p>Cheaper than a Kinect (R.I.P.) and cooler than a nostalgic Eyetoy, play with : <br> A webcam + post-its + a ruler.</p>
